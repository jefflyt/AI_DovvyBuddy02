# Step 1.4: Create .nvmrc File

**Part of:** Step 1 from plan.md  
**Focus:** Create .nvmrc to enforce Node.js version requirement  
**File to Create:** `.nvmrc` (root)  
**Estimated Time:** 5 minutes

## Overview

This substep creates an .nvmrc file that specifies the Node.js version requirement (20+) for the project. This ensures all developers use the correct Node version when using nvm (Node Version Manager).

## Pre-Substep Checklist

- [ ] **Branch:** Working on `1.1-monorepo-init`
- [ ] **Prior Step:** Completed Step 1.3 (.gitignore created)
- [ ] **Location:** At project root

## Implementation

### Goal
Create .nvmrc file to enforce Node.js 20+ requirement.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Step 1: Create .nvmrc File
- [ ] Ensure you're in the project root directory
- [ ] Copy and paste the following content into `.nvmrc` at the root:

```
20
```

That's it - just the number `20` on a single line.

#### Step 2: Verify Node Version (if using nvm)
- [ ] If you have nvm installed, test the .nvmrc file:

```bash
nvm use
```

Expected output: `Now using node v20.x.x`

- [ ] If you don't have Node 20 installed yet:

```bash
nvm install
```

This will install Node 20 as specified in .nvmrc

#### Step 3: Verify Current Node Version
- [ ] Check your current Node version:

```bash
node --version
```

Expected output: `v20.x.x` or higher

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] File saved in correct location: `.nvmrc` (at project root)
- [ ] File contains only `20` (no extra spaces or lines)
- [ ] `nvm use` switches to Node 20 (if nvm installed)
- [ ] `node --version` shows v20 or higher

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `nvm: command not found` | nvm is optional; developers can install Node 20 manually from nodejs.org |
| Node version still showing v18 or lower | Run `nvm use` or manually switch to Node 20 |
| `.nvmrc` not recognized | Ensure file has no extension (not `.nvmrc.txt`) |

## Files Modified

- [ ] ✅ Created: `.nvmrc` (root)

## What Comes Next

- Next step: Step 2 - Linting & Formatting Configuration
- .nvmrc ensures consistent Node version across all developers
- Step 1 (Root Configuration & Workspace Setup) is now complete
